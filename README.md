## Interpreting-CNN-Filters-for-Age-Detection-via-Activation-Maps
### This research seeks to show activation maps within a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for age identification. By examining these maps, we can determine which picture areas are most significant in the network's age prediction process.
